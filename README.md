# COP3530_Project_2

Four separate template-based implementation classes to implement distinct TreeMaps.

4 Classes: 
-BSTLEAF: inserts at leaf 
-BSTROOT: inserts at root 
-BSTRAND: inserts randomly 
-AVL: inserts then balances according to AVL-balance rules (also balances when necessary during removes).
